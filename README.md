Learning how to eat healthy and making a lifestyle change is overwhelming and difficult. There is a lack of education and many new habits that need to be developed which deter people from meeting their health goals. Reading food labels to track calories and other nutritional factors is tedious and time-consuming.

Nutrivurv is an application that helps users take control of a healthier lifestyle. The application makes it easy to track critical health information; whether that is macros, calories, or any other food data that you use in working towards a healthier life.
